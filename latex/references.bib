abstract = "The purpose of the present paper is improving the accuracy of existing formulas for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (LDC) prediction based on a novel and simple meta-heuristic optimization method called Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Although several existing formulas calculate LDC in the rivers based on the hydraulic and hydrodynamic specifications, most of them have significant errors in confronting extensive field data. In this study, comprehensive field data, including the geometrical and hydraulic properties of different rivers in the world, were adopted to build a reliable model. Statistical error measures were used to evaluate and compare the results with other studies. Furthermore, the Subset Selection of Maximum Dissimilarity (SSMD) method was utilized for a reputable selection of data for training and testing the WOA model. Subset selection is a critical factor in artificial intelligence (AI) computations. Finally, an integrated model based on the SSMD method and WOA technique has been proposed to develop the high accuracy formulas for the prediction of LDC. According to the results, the developed formulas are competitive or superior to the previous formulas for LDC estimation. Results also indicated that the WOA algorithm could be applied to improve the performance of the predictive equations in other fields of studies by finding the optimum values of coefficients."

In this regards, this study aims to introduce an appropriate approach to estimate LDC in natural rivers that is based on a hybrid method of granular computing (GRC) and an artificial neural network (ANN) model (GRC-ANN). Also, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANN models were developed to investigate the accuracy of three credible artificial intelligence (AI) models and the performance of these models in different LDC values. By comparing with empirical models developed in other studies, the results revealed the superior performance of GRC-ANN for LDC estimation. The sensitivity analysis of the three intelligent models developed in this study was done to determine the sensitivity of each model to its input parameters, especially the most important ones. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the W/H parameter (W: channel width; H: flow depth) has the most significant impact on the output of all three models in this research.}",

    abstract = { The longitudinal dispersion coefficient (LDC) plays an important role in modeling the transport of pollutants and sediment in natural rivers. As a result of transportation processes, the concentration of pollutants changes along the river. Various studies have been conducted to provide simple equations for estimating LDC. In this study, machine learning methods, namely support vector regression, Gaussian process regression, M5 model tree (M5P) and random forest, and multiple linear regression were examined in predicting the LDC in natural streams. Data sets from 60 rivers around the world with different hydraulic and geometric features were gathered to develop models for LDC estimation. Statistical criteria, including correlation coefficient (CC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to scrutinize the models. The LDC values estimated by these models were compared with the corresponding results of common empirical models. The Taylor chart was used to evaluate the models and the results showed that among the machine learning models, M5P had superior performance, with CC of 0.823, RMSE of 454.9 and MAE of 380.9. The model of Sahay and Dutta, with CC of 0.795, RMSE of 460.7 and MAE of 306.1, gave more precise results than the other empirical models. The main advantage of M5P models is their ability to provide practical formulae. In conclusion, the results proved that the developed M5P model with simple formulations was superior to other machine learning models and empirical models; therefore, it can be used as a proper tool for estimating the LDC in rivers. }

In this paper, we show that while K12(x) is an elementary function, K12,w(x) can be written in the form of an infinite series of Humbert functions. As an application of this result, we generalize the transformation formula for the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function η(z). We also establish a connection between K12,w(x) and the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the Voigt line profile."

Gaussian process regression is a powerful, non-parametric Bayesian approach towards regression problems that can be utilized in exploration and exploitation scenarios. This tutorial aims to provide an accessible introduction to these techniques. We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration–exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies. Beyond that, we describe a situation modelling risk-averse exploration in which an additional constraint (not to sample below a certain threshold) needs to be accounted for. Lastly, we summarize recent psychological experiments utilizing Gaussian processes. Software and literature pointers are also provided."

The special attention is paid to recently developed variants of Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The most commonly used gradient-based optimization methods have two significant drawbacks: they cannot cope with non-differentiable problems and quickly converge to local optima. These problems can be avoided by the application of EC techniques. Although a great amount of various EC algorithms have been proposed in recent years, only some of them have been applied to neural network training – usually with no comparison to other methods. We restrict our comparison to the regression problem with limited data and noise injection technique used to avoid premature convergence and to improve robustness of the model. The optimization methods tested in the present paper are: Distributed DE with Explorative–Exploitative Population Families, Self-Adaptive DE, DE with Global and Local Neighbors, Grouping DE, JADE, Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization, Efficient Population Utilization Strategy Particle Swarm Optimization and Covariance Matrix Adaptation – Evolution Strategy."

Our proposal integrates feature selection for regression, model evaluation, and decision making, in order to choose the most satisfactory model according to an a posteriori process in a multi-objective context.

The thalweg sinuosity has been computed for the main alluvial section of the river. Remarkable sinuosity changes have been found to correlate with discharge and sediment load changes at the inflow of tributaries, as well as with active deformation areas, like differential subsidence and wrench fault zones. Analysing the change of the river pattern, a new discrimination line has been derived, which separates the meandering zone on the classic slope vs. discharge diagram into two subzones. The first subzone (lower slope values) corresponds to a range of true, self-organized meandering. The second subzone (higher slope values) corresponds to a range of ‘unorganized meandering’. This is a range where river sinuosity decreases although the channel slope increases. In the case of the Tisza River, this subzone equals to the wandering river pattern."

Vegetation plays an important role in controlling mixing and contaminant removal in wetlands. Recent studies have shown that the hydraulic performance of a wetland can be significantly affected by the presence of a main flow channel (MFC) where vegetation density is much lower than the average vegetation density in the wetland. The existence of a main flow channel induces short-circuiting, which reduces hydraulic and treatment efficiency. A numerical study was carried out to analyze the effect of channel sinuosity and vegetation density on the hydraulic performance of a channelized wetland. A rectangular wetland characterized by a meandering channel and later vegetated zones (LVZs) was considered, and numerical simulations were carried out using a 2-D depth-average hydrodynamic and solute transport model. The hydraulic performance was analyzed as a function of the average vegetation density, channel sinuosity and the ratio of vegetation densities in the LVZs and the MFC. Results show that increasing sinuosity of the main flow channel can promote mixing and improve hydraulic efficiency. Different performance metrics also indicate negligible impact of the average vegetation density on the hydraulic performance, especially when the width of the MFC is relatively large."

River sinuosity has an impact on riparian vegetation through different processes. The obvious one is the increment of the length of the riparian corridor due to meandering-induced river elongation. However, additional more subtle aspects occur, ascribable to topographic changes induced by meandering dynamics and to their impact on the stochastic structure of the river stage time series. It follows that the increment in vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment in the river length. In this work, we investigate this complex picture using suitable bio-geomorphological models through the study of an exemplifying case. This approach can suggest some novel tools for design the restoration of riparian corridors."

abstract = {Strong feedbacks exist between channel dynamics, floodplain development, and riparian vegetation. Earlier experimental studies showed how uniformly distributed riparian vegetation causes a shift from a braided to a single-thread river because riparian vegetation stabilizes the banks and focuses discharge off the floodplains into channels. These experiments tested anemochorously distributed vegetation, i.e., by wind, whereas many riparian species in nature are also distributed hydrochorously, i.e., by flowing water. The objective of this study is to test experimentally what the different effects are of hydrochorously and anemochorously distributed vegetation on channel pattern and dynamics. The experiments were carried out in a flume of 3 m wide and 10 m long. We compared experiments with the two forms of vegetation distribution methods to control experiments without vegetation. To independently quantify bank retreat rate as a function of seed density and vegetation age, we used a small bank erosion test. In agreement with other work, the uniformly distributed vegetation decreased bank retreat, often stabilized banks and tightened meander bends. Vegetation seeds distributed by the flow during floods settled at lower elevations compared to the uniformly distributed vegetation. Inner bend vegetation stabilized a part of the point bar and hydraulic resistance of the vegetated bar forced water into the channel and over the floodplain. As a result, sediment was deposited upstream of vegetation patches. We conclude that seeds distributed by the flow during floods lead to island braiding: a patchy multithread river with stable vegetated bars, whereas vegetation uniformly distributed on the floodplain of a single-thread meandering river increases sinuosity and decreases bend wavelength. This implies that the combination of discharge variations and vegetation settling behavior has a large effect on the morphology and dynamics of rivers. The experimental approach opens up a wide range of possibilities to explore hydro-bio-geomorphological interactions with a high degree of control.},

abstract = "For the classification of motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG), appropriate features are crucial to obtain a high classification accuracy. Considering the characteristics of the EEG signals, the time-frequency-space three-dimensional features are extracted. Due to a considerable number of the extracted features, the performance of a classifier will degrade. Therefore, it is necessary to implement feature selection. However, existing feature selection methods are easy to fall into a local optimum of a high-dimensional feature selection problem. In this paper, a dimensionality reduction mechanism (called DimReM) is proposed, which gradually reduces the dimension of the search space by removing some unimportant features. In principle, DimReM transforms a high-dimensional feature selection problem into a low-dimensional one. DimReM does not introduce any additional parameters and its implementation is simple. To verify its effectiveness, DimReM is combined with different evolutionary algorithms and different classifiers to select features on various kinds of datasets. Compared with evolutionary algorithms without dimensionality reduction, their augmented versions equipped with DimReM can find feature subsets with higher classification accuracies while smaller numbers of selected features."

Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify that the proposed method is successful in feature selection while achieving high accuracy in both regression and classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose a fast variant of CMA-ES (Fast CMA-ES) to handle large-scale black-box optimization problems. We approximate the covariance matrix by a low-rank matrix with a few vectors and use two of them to generate each new solution. The algorithm achieves linear internal complexity on the dimension of search space. We illustrate that the covariance matrix of the underlying distribution can be considered as an ensemble of simple models constructed by two vectors. We experimentally investigate the algorithm's behaviors and performances. It is more efficient than the CMA-ES in terms of running time. It outperforms or performs comparatively to the variant limited memory CMA-ES on large-scale problems. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm's performance with a restart strategy on the CEC'2010 large-scale global optimization benchmarks, and it shows remarkable performance and outperforms the large-scale variants of the CMA-ES.},

In the paper we propose a direct formulation of the covariance function for multi-response GPR, based on the idea that its covariance function is assumed to be the “nominal” uni-output covariance multiplied by the covariances between different outputs. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-response GPR method is illustrated through numerical examples and response surface modelling of a catalytic reaction process."
